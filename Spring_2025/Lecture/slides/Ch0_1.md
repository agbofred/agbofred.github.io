## Icebreaker 
:::incremental
- What’s the most interesting thing you’ve ever used a computer for?
- What’s the first word that comes to mind when you think about programming?
- Imagine you're debugging your morning routine. What’s one "bug" you’d fix?
- If you were a computer, what would your "error message" say?
:::

:::notes
Discuss my own motivations as well!

## Motivations
:::incremental
- The field of computing today is scarcely recognizable compared to the field 50 years ago.
- Many feel the pace of the field is only accelerating as we move forwards.
- Studying computing now lets you take part in driving forward not only the field of computing, but of all the modern fields with utilize computing.
	- Almost all fields!

## How to Succeed
- People enter this course with a variety of initial experiences
	- This course is built for an individual entering with **zero** coding experience
- Path to Success
	- There is a significant time committment for this course
		- The only way to get good at coding is to **do** coding
		- Coding can often times involve a lot of frustrating troubleshooting or failed attempts
		- Expect, on average, the full use of WU's 2-3 hours outside class for every hour in class
	- If you are stuck for more than 30 minutes, _ask for help_ from your section leaders, colleagues, QUAD, or _myself_
		- While it is important to give yourself time to troubleshoot, when you are learning, being stuck for long leads to frustration


## My Goals
::: {.block name="Primary Objective"}
To gain the skills, knowledge, and confidence necessary to write, test, and debug Python programs requiring several hundred lines of code.
:::

Doing so will require that students be able to:

- implement simple algorithms using Python control structures,
- apply decomposition and step-wise refinement techniques,
- design data structures to model information,
- execute all phases of the programming process, including design, implementation, testing and debugging

## Your Goals?

- Fill out this short survey on your goals with this [link](https://www.polleverywhere.com/agbofred203)
- Keep this link for subsequent class polls

## Grading
::::cols
:::col
- Standard 90/80/70 etc grade cut-offs
	- Top 2% get +'s, bottom 2% get -'s

## Participation
- Scored through participation in class polls, in-class collaborations, or contacting me with a question about a specific slide.
- Sometimes 1-2 polls per day
- Answering any poll gets you full points for the day (even if you are wrong!)
- Answering correctly gets you bits of extra credit
- Polling website at this [link](https://www.polleverywhere.com/agbofred203)
	- Will start officially on Friday
- Participate in using an online tool (__Pensieve__) for in-class collaboration

---

## Homework
- Falls into two categories:
	- _Problem Sets:_ smaller, more focused assignments
		- Graded on standard, numeric scales
	- _Projects:_ larger, more integrative assignments
		- Graded on a more qualitative scale (next slides)
- All will be due on Mondays at 10:00pm
- Submissions of _both_ will be handled through Github Classroom and __Pensieve__
	- Learn how to use GitHub for this class from Jed's __videos__. 
	- Follow along in todays class to learn how I do it
	- __Pensieve__ will be introduced in week 2
- 3 cumulative late days (24 hours max) over the entire semester without penalty then penalties enacted for each subsequent day late (***see the syllabus***).
- Extensions for any reason need to be requested and approved by myself before the due date

## Project Scoring

------ ---   -----------------
     105   A submission so good it "makes me weep"
      100   Exceeds requirements
     95    Satisfies all assignment requirements
      90    Meets most requirements, but some issues
     80    Some more serious problems evident
      60    Even worse...
     30    Why even bother turning this in?
------ -----------------


## Sections
- Everyone will be placed into small sections of approx. 8-10 students, with one section leader
- All section leaders are students who recently took and excelled in this course
- Will meet as a group with your section leader once a week for an hour to go over and work on problems/projects
	- These meetings will be on Mondays or Tuesdays and __it is mandatory__
	- You can have 3 excused absenses throughout the semester. Contact section leader prior when you will be absent.
		- beyond 3 absenses (excused or not will cause you 5% deduction from your cummulative grade)
	- Poll out **today** where you can enter in your availability on these days so that we can get people placed into sections
- Section leaders will serve as your major support! Ask for help or guidance from them weekly
- **Prof. Jed** is in charge of the sections and they are planning to start section meetings _next_ week


## Tests
- Tests are necessary to assure retention of material and ensure that some are not getting too much help on the assignments.
- Just two midterm this semester and one final:
	- Midterm 1 on Fed 21 (in-class, use of computer, partially open)
	- Midterm 2 on March 21 (in-class, use computer, totally open)
	- Final:
		- 10:20 – 11:20 M/W/F -> Friday 2nd May (8:am - 11am)
		- 12:00 – 1:00 M/W/F -> Wednesday 7th May (2:00pm - 5pm)
		 - See this [calendar](https://willamette.edu/offices/registrar/info/spring/finals/index.html) to confirm your exact date. (Finals are in-class, use of computer, partially open)

- This policy has actually been seen to _improve_ student scores, as it prevents you from wasting tons of time obsessing about a small mistake!
- Example tests and study materials will be given out in advance.


## Communication
- I have had much better luck recently channeling class communication (announcements, questions, answers, etc) through a class Discord server and on Canvas
	- Invite instructions are posted on the main Canvas landing page and on the second slides for this class
	- Totally free to sign up and use Discord
	- If you already use Discord, you _can_ create another account to switch between, or you can use your existing account
- Both Canvas and Discord will be the main online location for announcements and questions and answers.
- Discord has support for code-blocks when talking about code by surrounding code in triple backticks: ` ```this is formatted nicely as code``` `{.text}

## Course Policy: Use of AI or Genenerative AI
- I recognize the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence GenAI in intro programming course. 
- As such, I encourage students to explore and utilize these technologies __ONLY__ as supplementary learning tools
- AI can be an excellent resource for:
	- Explaining complex concepts, Providing coding examples, debugging suggestions
	- Recommending best practices, Exploring new ideas and approaches
- Do not use AI to directly solve assignments: Assignments are designed to develop your skills and understanding. 
- Using AI to generate solutions for assignments is strictly prohibited.
- Acknowledge AI usage when you use it for inspiration or assistance in your work, clearly acknowledge it. 
	- Include a brief note explaining how and where AI was used.
	

## Course Policy: Academic Honesty

1. Learning programming, in most cases is by copying, integrating, & debugging codes. 
	- Use these strategies in a very helpful manner 
	- Be honest and transparent 
		- __trust the instructor not to mark you down when you disclose your helper__
	- Use pensieve AI to learn and collaborate
2. You must not copy someone entire solutions or program code and paste as though it is your own. __This is plagiarism!!!__  
3. You must not share your solutions or code with other students. 
	- But you can explain to them on how to solve the problem.
    - You are also encouraged to work alongside others enroute to finding a solution.
4. You must indicate on all your submitted assignment who, what, or where you received any assistance.



## Diving In
::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
- This course is an introduction on _computer science_, and covers more than just programming!
- Python is used to teach the programming portion of the course, but the focus is less on Python itself and more on general computer science principles.
- If you come across situations where you need to know a bit more about specific Python details, there are plenty of resources online, or just ask me!

## Effective Communication
::: incremental
- To communicate effectively with someone or something, you really need two layers of communication:
	- A shared language or method of conveying information 
		- The English alphabet, for example
		- In our case, Python
	- A joint agreement about what constitutes **meaning**
		- Need ways to limit confusion or misunderstanding
			- Following conventions
		- Being able to explain things clearly and unambiguously
:::

## Giving Clear Instructions
- We will initially make the language _extremely_ simple so that we can focus on the second layer
- Karel the Robot exists in a very simple 2D world
- Has a very limited set of actions:
	- Can move forward one space
	- Can rotate counter-clockwise (turn left) 90 degrees
	- Can pick up a beeper
	- Can drop off a beeper
- We will be spending the first several class days just interested in how we can take these simple instructions and get Karel to solve a wide variety of problems
	- This content is not in your book, but more in-depth descriptions can be found [here](https://willamette.edu/~esroberts/pykarel/reader/01-IntroducingKarel.html)

## The Karel World
::::::cols
::::col
- Karel's world is defined on a grid
	- _avenues_ run north-south
	- _streets_ run east-west
	- The _intersection_ between a street and avenue is called a corner
- Compass directions are as you'd have them on a map, with North pointing upwards
- Walls are impassable
- Beepers are diamonds
- Karel is a house-shaped polygon
::::

::::col
\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=100%
\karelgrid[MGreen]{3}{3}
\draw[MGreen, very thick] (3.5,2.5) --+(-1,0);
\karelbeeper[MBlue]{3}{1}
\karelmark[MYellow]{2}{3}{90}
\end{tikzpicture}

::::
::::::

## Karel Commands
- As we mentioned before, Karel is a simple robot, and can really only do 4 potential actions

	 Command | Action
	:----|:--------
	`move()` | Moves Karel forward one corner in whatever direction they are facing
	`turn_left()` | Rotates Karel 90 deg counter-clockwise
	`pick_beeper()` | Picks up a beeper on the ground
	`put_beeper()` | Places a beeper on the ground

- Our commands are just sequences of these actions

## Example
::::::cols
::::col
- Suppose we had the situation to the right and wanted to navigate to the beeper, pick it up, and then drop it at the corner of 1st avenue and 1st street.
- Take a moment to write out your instructions.
	- Remember you can only move, rotate left, and pick up or drop the beeper
- Note that there are multiple ways to do this! Which is better?
::::

::::col
\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=100%
\karelgrid[MGreen]{3}{3}

\draw[MGreen, very thick] (3.5,2.5) --+(-1,0) (0.5,1.5) --+ (2,0);
\karelbeeper[MBlue]{3}{1}
\karelmark[MYellow]{1}{3}{0}

\end{tikzpicture}

## One Solution
```{.python style='max-height:800px'}
def main():
	move()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	move()
	turn_left()
	move()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	move()
	pick_beeper()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	move()
	move()
	put_beeper()
```



## GitHub Classroom Demonstration
- There will be instructions on how to run through this process on Jed's video
- but I'll (as time permits) demonstrate how you would usually use GitHub Classroom
- Grab the PS0 posted in week 1 on canvas to test if your installation stack is working
