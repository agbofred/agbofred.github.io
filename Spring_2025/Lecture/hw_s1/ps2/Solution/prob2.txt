Step-by-step algorithm in plain English:
1. Calculate Initial Areas:
    1.1 Compute the area of the first square: A²
    1.2 Compute the area of the second square: B²
2. Calculate Overlap Area:
    2.1 Determine the overlap area as d².
3. Compute Total Shaded Area:
    3.1 Subtract the overlap area from the sum of the two initial areas: A² + B² - 2d².


This will give you the total shaded area when the squares overlap by a distance . Let me know if you need further clarification!
