Here are some well-structured coding exercises for practicing variables and assignment statements in Python, suitable for introductory college students:
Exercise 1: Basic Variable Assignment
# Task: Create variables to store information about a student
# 1. Create a variable for student name
# 2. Create a variable for student age 
# 3. Create a variable for student's GPA
# 4. Print all variables

# Write your code below:
name = "John Smith"
age = 19
gpa = 3.75

print(name)
print(age)
print(gpa)
Exercise 2: Variable Swapping
# Task: Swap the values of two variables
# 1. Create two variables x and y with initial values
# 2. Swap their values using a third variable
# 3. Print the values before and after swapping

# Write your code below:
x = 10
y = 20

print("Before swapping:")
print("x =", x)
print("y =", y)

temp = x
x = y
y = temp

print("\nAfter swapping:")
print("x =", x)
print("y =", y)
Exercise 3: Temperature Converter
# Task: Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius
# 1. Create a variable to store temperature in Fahrenheit
# 2. Convert it to Celsius using the formula: (F - 32) * 5/9
# 3. Store the result in a new variable
# 4. Print both temperatures

# Write your code below:
fahrenheit = 98.6
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9

print(fahrenheit, "degrees Fahrenheit is")
print(celsius, "degrees Celsius")
Exercise 4: Rectangle Calculator
# Task: Calculate area and perimeter of a rectangle
# 1. Create variables for length and width
# 2. Calculate and store the area in a new variable
# 3. Calculate and store the perimeter in a new variable
# 4. Print all values

# Write your code below:
length = 5
width = 3

area = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

print("Rectangle dimensions:", length, "x", width)
print("Area:", area)
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)
Exercise 5: String Manipulation
# Task: Work with string variables
# 1. Create variables for first name and last name
# 2. Create a variable for full name by combining them
# 3. Create a variable with the full name in uppercase
# 4. Print all variations

# Write your code below:
first_name = "Jane"
last_name = "Doe"

full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
upper_name = full_name.upper()

print("First name:", first_name)
print("Last name:", last_name)
print("Full name:", full_name)
print("Uppercase:", upper_name)
These exercises progress from simple to more complex assignments and include:
Basic variable creation and printing
Working with multiple variables
Mathematical operations with variables
String manipulation
Different data types (integers, floats, strings)
Key learning outcomes:
Understanding variable declaration and assignment
Working with different data types
Basic operations with variables
Printing variable values
String concatenation
Simple mathematical calculations
Each exercise includes:
Clear task description
Step-by-step instructions
Comments explaining what each section does
Space for students to write their code
Expected output demonstration
You can ask students to:
Predict the output before running the code
Modify values and observe changes
Add additional variables or operations
Experiment with different data types
Write their own similar exercises
