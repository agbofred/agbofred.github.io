## Arrays and Lists
- From the earliest days, programming languages have supported the idea of an _array_, or an ordered sequence of values.
- Individual values in an array are called _elements_, and the number of elements is the _length_ of the array.
- Each element's position in the array is given by its _index_, with index numbers starting at 0 and extending up to 1 less than the length of the array
- Python implements the array concept in a bit more general form called a _list_.


## Reminder: Making Lists
- Created using square brackets with elements separated by commas:
  ```python
  COIN_VALUES = [1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100]
  COIN_NAMES = [ "penny", "nickle", "dime",
                 "quarter", "half-dollar", "dollar" ]
  ```
- Lists are commonly represented visually or conceptually as a series of numbered boxes:
\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=80%
[box/.style={draw, thick, MBlue, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=1cm, font=\tt, text width=2cm, align=center}]
\node[box, label={[MPurple,font=\footnotesize]below:0}](0) at (0,0) {1};
\node[box, label={[MPurple,font=\footnotesize]below:1}, right=0cm of 0](1) {5};
\node[box, label={[MPurple,font=\footnotesize]below:2}, right=0cm of 1](2) {10};
\node[box, label={[MPurple,font=\footnotesize]below:3}, right=0cm of 2](3) {25};
\node[box, label={[MPurple,font=\footnotesize]below:4}, right=0cm of 3](4) {50};
\node[box, label={[MPurple,font=\footnotesize]below:5}, right=0cm of 4](5) {100};
\node[anchor=south west, font=\tt\footnotesize, color=MGreen] at (0.north west) {COIN\_VALUES};
\node[box, label={[MPurple,font=\footnotesize]below:0}](0) at (0,-2) {"penny"};
\node[box, label={[MPurple,font=\footnotesize]below:1}, right=0cm of 0](1) {"nickel"};
\node[box, label={[MPurple,font=\footnotesize]below:2}, right=0cm of 1](2) {"dime"};
\node[box, label={[MPurple,font=\footnotesize]below:3}, right=0cm of 2](3) {"quarter"};
\node[box, label={[MPurple,font=\footnotesize]below:4}, right=0cm of 3](4) {"half-\\dollar"};
\node[box, label={[MPurple,font=\footnotesize]below:5}, right=0cm of 4](5) {"dollar"};
\node[anchor=south west, font=\tt\footnotesize, color=MGreen] at (0.north west) {COIN\_NAMES};
\end{tikzpicture}


## What we already know
- Can retrieve the value of any element in a list by writing the index of that element in square brackets after the list name
	- `COIN_VALUES[3]` ⟶ `25`
	- `COIN_NAMES[2]` ⟶ `"dime"`
- Can concatenate two lists to form a new list with elements from both
    - `[1,2,3] + [4,5,6]`⟶  `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`

- Can loop through each of the list elements in turn
  ```python
  for elem in my_list:
  	# do stuff with elem
  ```
  where `elem` is the name of the variable that will sequentially get assigned the value of every element in `my_list`

## Sequences
- Sound familiar? Lists are just like more general strings!
- Strings and lists are examples of a more general class of object in Python called _sequences_

::::::cols
::::col
:::{.block name=Old}
- We already knew that all sequences support:
  - The `len` function
  - Index numbering starting at 0
  - Concatenation using `+` or `+=`
  - Selection of an individual element using square brackets
  - Looping over elements
:::
::::

::::col
:::{.block name=New .fragment}
- We can now add:
  - Negative index numbering counting backwards from the end 
  - Slicing in all forms
  - Comparing sequences
  - Repetition using `*`
  - Inclusion testing using `in` operator

## Understanding Check! {data-notes="Solution: None of the above, as it errors"}
What would the below expression evaluate to?

<center>
<code>["One", 2, True][-1:1:-1][1]</code>
</center>

:::{.poll}
#. `"n"`
#. `2`
#. `True`
#. None of the above, or this will error

## Mutants
- The most important difference between strings and lists is one of _mutability_
	- Strings we have already identified as being _immutable_: you can not change the individual elements
	- Lists, in contrast, are _mutable_, which means that we **can** change or assign new values to the elements of a list
- Immutable objects have many advantages in programming:
	- You don't have to worry about if the values will change
	- Immutable values can be more easily shared
	- Immutable objects are easier to use with concurrent programs
- In some situations though, mutable objects are the perfect tool for the job

## A Tutorial on Lists
::::::cols
::::col
- Thinking about mutable objects requires a shift in how we visualize our code interacting with the objects in memory
- [Link here](https://pythontutor.com/render.html#code=cool%20%3D%20%5B'blue',%20'violet'%5D%0Awarm%20%3D%20%5B'red',%20'orange'%5D%0A%0Acolors%20%3D%20%5Bcool,%20warm%5D%0Aother_colors%20%3D%20%5B%5B'blue',%20'violet'%5D,%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%5B'red',%20'orange'%5D%5D%0A%0Aprint%28colors%20%3D%3D%20other_colors%29%0Aprint%28colors%20is%20other_colors%29%0A%0Acool%5B0%5D%20%3D%20'indigo'%0Awarm%20%3D%20%5B'orange',%20'yellow'%5D%0A%0Aprint%28colors%29%0Aprint%28other_colors%29&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=false&mode=display&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false)
::::

::::{.col style="flex-grow:2;"}
```{.python style='max-height:900px; font-size:0.8em;'}
cool = ['blue', 'violet']
warm = ['red', 'orange']

colors = [cool, warm]
other_colors = [['blue', 'violet'],
				['red', 'orange']]

print(colors == other_colors)
print(colors is other_colors)

cool[0] = 'indigo'
warm = ['orange', 'yellow']

print(colors)
print(other_colors)
```
::::
::::::

## For Reference
- When working with mutable objects, it is better to think of the variable as holding a _reference_ to the object, rather than the actual contents of the object
- I find it useful to think of a reference as the "address" in memory where that object's contents can be found
- This undeniably complicates things, as referencing a mutable object lets you change it, which will immediately be reflected in anything _else_ that referenced that object
- Mutable objects can be terrific to work with, as their mutability makes them very flexible, but be wary of unexpected behavior

## Breakout History
> - The popular Breakout arcade game was released by Atari in 1976
> - Atari founder Nolan Bushnell wanted a new game that would build on the success of the earlier game Pong. He assigned Steve Jobs to develop the game, promising a bonus if the game required a small number of chips.
> - As Wikipedia tells the story, "Jobs had little specialized knowledge of circuit board design but knew [his friend Steve] Wozniak was capable of producing designs with a small number of chips. He convinced Wozniak to work with him, promising to split the fee evenly between them."
> - Wozniak completed the game design in four days, but Jobs never told him about the bonus offer. Jobs was paid $\$5,000$, but Wozniak received only $\$350$.
> - Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple Computer the following year, which has grown to be the largest corporation in the world by market capitalization.


## Breakout Basics
::::::{.cols style='align-items: center'}
::::{.col style='font-size:.9em'}
- Breakout is a game in which the player attempts to break all the colored bricks by causing a bouncing ball to collide with them
- The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen which the ball will bounce off
    - The paddle can only move left and right
- If the ball makes it past the paddle to the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life
    - Lose 3 lives and it is game over!
