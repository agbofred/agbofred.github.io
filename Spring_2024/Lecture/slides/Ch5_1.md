## Review Question {data-notes="Answer is D"}
Which of the below images would be produced by the following code?
```python
gw = GWindow(200,200)
for c in range(0,10):
    for r in range(0,10):
        rect = GRect(20*c,20*r,20,20)
        if (r+c) % 2 != 0:

## Function Review
- A _function_ is just a sequence of statements that have been collected together and given a name
	- Makes it possible to execute the statements multiple times much more easily
- Some reminders about vocabulary:
	- Invoking or running a function by name is known as **calling** that function.
	- The caller passes information to a function using **arguments**.
	- When a function completes its block of code, it **returns** to its caller.
	- The function gives information back to the caller by **returning a result**
- Syntax:
  ```python
  def function_name( parameter_list ):
  	function_body
  ```

## Predicate Functions
- Functions that return a Boolean value are called _predicate functions_
  ```python
  def is_divisible_by(x, y):
  	return x % y == 0
  ```
- Once you have defined a predicate function, you can use it in any conditional expression!
  ```python
  for i in range(1, 100):
  	if is_divisible_by(i, 7):
  		print(i)
  ```


## Predicate No-nos
- Don't complicate your code for no reason!
- Work directly with the boolean values when possible
- Try not to code patterns like the following:
  ```{.python .badcode}
  def is_divisible_by(x, y):
  	if x % y == 0:
  		return True
  	else:
  		return False
  ```
  ```{.python .badcode}
  for i in range(1, 100):
  	if is_divisible_by(i,7) == True:
  		print(i)
  ```

## Parameter Purposes
- Functions perform some sort of service for their callers
- It is necessary for them to know enough details so that they can carry out the requested task
	- Imagine you were trying to accomplish the task yourself!
	- What is the minimum amount of information you would need to know?
- The necessary information needed for the function to generally accomplish its task is the information conveyed in the parameters


## Jockeying for Position
- So far we have used a positional way to assign arguments to parameters

	```python-repl
	>>> def func( first, second, third ):
			print( first, second, third )
	>>> func(1,2,3)
	1 2 3
	>>> func(2,6,4)
	2 6 4
	```
	- First argument to first parameter, second to second parameter, etc

## The Word is Key
- Arguments may also be specified by a _keyword_, in which the caller precedes the argument with a parameter name and equals sign
- Always stores the argument value in the specified parameter

  ```python-repl
  >>>  def func( first, second, third ):
  		print( first, second, third )
  >>>  func(third=4, first=2, second=6)
  2 6 4
  ```
- Keyword arguments can appear in any order
- **All keyword arguments must come after any positional arguments!**


## Default Slide Title
- Python allows you to specify a default value for a parameter, which is will use if one is not directly supplied
- Do so by adding an equals sign and a value after the parameter name
	- So you define default values when you define the function
```python
def introduction(name='Jed', age=35):
	print(f'My name is {name} and I am {age}')
```
- If providing any parameters after a default parameter, you must indicate them through keywords
  ```{.python-repl style="max-height: 200px"}
  >>> introduction()
  My name is Jed and I am 35
  >>> introduction('Bob', 25)
  My name is Bob and I am 25
  >>> introduction('Larry')
  My name is Larry and I am 35
  >>> introduction(age=68)
  My name is Jed and I am 68
  ```

What would be the printed value of z at the end of the code to the right?

#. None of the above

## Walk through vegas
- Consider the code to below. When the final value of ```x``` and ```z``` are printed, what will their value be?
```python
def Vegas(x):
    y = 2
    for i in range(5):
        x += y
    return x

x = 3
z = Vegas(x)
print('z =', z)
print('x =', x)
```

## Mystery word
- Let us walk through this program and unravel what will be printed when the program complete execution.

```python
def mystery (x):
    def enigma (s, t):
        t -= 2
    return s [::6] + s[t]
y = len(x)
z = x[1 - y]
z += enigma (x, y)
z += enigma (x, y - 2)
print(z)

if __name__ == '__main__ ':
    print( mystery ("abcdefgh"))



```

## Graphic function with default color
- You can return any type of variable from a function, including GObject graphical objects
- Can be useful to write simple functions that bundle together common tasks
    - For instance, to create a filled circle centered at some location:

```python
def make_filled_circ(x_cent, y_cent, radius, color='black'):
    circle = GOval(x_cent-radius, y_cent-radius, 2*radius, 2*radius)
    circle.set_color(color)
    circle.set_filled(True)
    return circle

```

## Summary of a Function Call 

:::{.incremental style='font-size:.8em'}
#. Evaluate the arguments in the context of the caller
#. Reserve space for the function in a new stack frame
#. Copy each positional argument to the corresponding parameter variable
#. Copy each keyword argument to the parameter with that name
#. For parameters with default values, if not already assigned, assign those values
#. Evaluate statements in the function body, using current stack frame to look up values of local variables
#. On encountering a `return`, compute the return value and substitute that value in place of the function call
#. Remove the stack frame
#. Return to the caller, continuing from just after the function call
:::


## Name Resolution and Scope
- When Python encounters a variable name in a program, it looks for where the variable was defined in an expanding search:
	1. **Local** - The local context is all the variables defined within the current function. This includes variables appearing as a parameter!
	2. **Enclosing** - The enclosing context consists of the names defined in a function enclosing the current one.
	3. **Global** - The global context consists of names defined outside of any function or imported into the current module.
	4. **Built-in** - The last place Python looks is in the names of any built-in functions, like `abs`, `str`, `print`, etc.
- The part of a program in which a name is defined in called its _scope_

## Scoping Example
```{.python data-line-numbers="" style='max-height:900px'}
def func1(x,y):
	return z + func2(x,y)

def func2(x,y):
	def func3(x):
		return (y + x) ** 2

	z = x - func3(y)
	return z - y

z = 1
print(func1(2,z))
```

## Local Variables
- In Python, assigning any value to a variable means that the variable is assumed to be _local_
	- This generally makes sense, as you would not want more specific functions overriding variables in other areas
- Can lead to issues though:
  ```{.python .badcode}
  def increment():
  	x = x + 1
  
  x = 0
  increment()
  ```
- The variable x in the fuction is local within that scope, and another ***global*** x with value 0 can cause issues
