- We are in Ch6 of the text this week, which is interactive graphics
- Remember the __1st midterm exam is this Friday Feb 23__ in this hall
	- I will provide more information about the exam right this morning
	- Those with accommodations with **Testing Center** should contact them to make arrangement NOW!  and cc me in the email
- Polling continues [https://www.polleverywhere.com/agbofred203](https://www.polleverywhere.com/agbofred203)


## Mystery word
- Let us walk through this program and unravel what will be printed when the program complete execution.

```python
def mystery (x):
    def enigma (s, t):
        t -= 2
      return s [::6] + s[t]
  y = len(x)
  z = x[1 - y]
  z += enigma (x, y)
  z += enigma (x, y - 2)
  print(z)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(mystery ("abcdefgh"))



```

## Graphic function with default color
- You can return any type of variable from a function, including GObject graphical objects
- Can be useful to write simple functions that bundle together common tasks
    - For instance, to create a filled circle centered at some location:

```python
def make_filled_circ(x_cent, y_cent, radius, color='black'):
    circle = GOval(x_cent-radius, y_cent-radius, 2*radius, 2*radius)
    circle.set_color(color)
    circle.set_filled(True)
    return circle

```

## Summary of a Function Call 

:::{.incremental style='font-size:.8em'}
#. Evaluate the arguments in the context of the caller
#. Reserve space for the function in a new stack frame
#. Copy each positional argument to the corresponding parameter variable
#. Copy each keyword argument to the parameter with that name
#. For parameters with default values, if not already assigned, assign those values
#. Evaluate statements in the function body, using current stack frame to look up values of local variables
#. On encountering a `return`, compute the return value and substitute that value in place of the function call
#. Remove the stack frame
#. Return to the caller, continuing from just after the function call

## Name Resolution and Scope
- When Python encounters a variable name in a program, it looks for where the variable was defined in an expanding search:
	1. **Local** - The local context is all the variables defined within the current function. This includes variables appearing as a parameter!
	2. **Enclosing** - The enclosing context consists of the names defined in a function enclosing the current one.
	3. **Global** - The global context consists of names defined outside of any function or imported into the current module.
	4. **Built-in** - The last place Python looks is in the names of any built-in functions, like `abs`, `str`, `print`, etc.
- The part of a program in which a name is defined in called its _scope_

## Scoping Example
```{.python data-line-numbers="" style='max-height:900px'}
def func1(x,y):
	return z + func2(x,y)

def func2(x,y):
	def func3(x):
		return (y + x) ** 2

	z = x - func3(y)
	return z - y

z = 1
print(func1(2,z))
```

## Local Variables
- In Python, assigning any value to a variable means that the variable is assumed to be _local_
	- This generally makes sense, as you would not want more specific functions overriding variables in other areas
- Can lead to issues though:
  ```{.python .badcode}
  def increment():
  	x = x + 1
  
  x = 0
  increment()
  ```
- The variable x in the fuction is local within that scope, and another ***global*** x with value 0 can cause issues


## Review Question! {data-notes="Answer is 27"}

::::::cols
::::col
What would be the printed value of z at the end of the code to the right?

:::{.poll}
#. 19
#. 25
#. 27
#. None of the above
:::

::::

::::col
```python
def f(x,y=0):
	z = (x + 3) ** 2
	return y + z

x = 1
z = x + f(y=x,x=2)
print(z)

```

    c.set_filled(True)

            randint(50,450),

def g(z,n):
	x = 2
	for i in range(n):
		x += z(i,n)
	return x

print(g(f,2))
```

:::col
What value will be printed to the screen when the code to the left is run?

:::::{.poll}
#. 2
#. 4
#. 7
#. This will give an error

## New Methods
:::{style='font-size:.9em'}
- A new method that acts on a `GWindow`:

 |
:---|:----
`get_element_at(x,y)`{.no-highlight} | Returns the frontmost object at (x,y) or `None`

- And more new methods that act on any `GObject`

 | 
:---|:---------
`set_location(x,y)`{.no-highlight} | Resets the location of the object to the specified point
`move(dx,dy)`{.no-highlight} | Moves the object `dx` and `dy` pixels from its current position
`move_polar(dr,theta)`{.no-highlight} | Moves the object `dr` pixel units in direction `theta`
`contains(x,y)`{.no-highlight} | Returns `True` if the object contains the specified point
`get_color()`{.no-highlight} | Returns the color currently assigned to the object

## The Python Event Model
- Graphical applications usually make it possible for the user to control the action of a program by using an input device such a mouse.
	- Programs supporting this type of control are called _interactive programs_.
- User actions such as clicking the mouse are called _events_.
- Programs that respond to events are said to be _event driven_.
- User input does not generally occur at predictable times. As the events are not controlled by the program, they are said to be _asynchronous_.
- In Python, you write a function that acts as a _listener_ for a particular event type. When the event happens, the listener is called.


## First Class Functions
- Functions in Python are treated as data values just like anything else!
	- We will need to take advantage of this to write listener functions.
- You can assign a function to a variable, pass it as a parameter, return it as a result, etc
- Functions treated like any other data value are called _first-class functions_
- To work with a function itself, you leave off the `()`. Including the parentheses is how you _call_ the function!



## A First Class Example
```{.python style='max-height:900px'}
import math

def evaluate_numbers(func):
	print(func)
	print(func(0))
	print(func(2))
	print(func(10))

A = evaluate_numbers

A(math.sqrt)
A(math.exp)
```


## Closures
::::cols
:::col
Consider the code to the right. 

::::: incremental
- Why does the line 12 not error?
    - Nothing named `a` should still exist when it is called!
- [Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=b%20%3D%201%0Adef%20f1%28a%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20print%28a%29%0A%20%20%20%20print%28b%29%0A%20%20%20%20def%20f2%28%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20c%20%3D%20a%20%2B%20b%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20return%20c%20*%203%0A%20%20%20%20return%20f2%20%0Af2%20%3D%20f1%2810%29%0Ac%20%3D%20f2%28%29&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=false&mode=display&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false)
- `f2` must also keep track of any local variables!
- The local variables that are included as part of a function are called its _closure_
:::::

:::
:::col
```{.python style='max-height:800px' data-line-numbers=''}
b = 1
def f1(a):
    print(a)
	print(b)

	def f2():
		c = a + b
		return c * 3
	return f2 

f2 = f1(10) 
c = f2()
```
