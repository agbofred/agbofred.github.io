## Review Question {data-notes="Solution: Jake {'A', 'C', 'B'}"}
::::::cols
::::{.col style='flex-grow:1.5;'}
Consider the program on the right hand side and the structure of the defined data. What will be printed to the terminal?
<br><br>

:::{.poll}
#. `course1[CS151]["Jake"]: {'A', 'B', 'C'}`
#. `['Jake': {'A', 'B', 'C'}]`
#. `Jake {'A', 'C', 'B'}`
#. `Sally {'A', 'B', 'B'}`

## Sample projects


## Compound Structure Storage
- Structures representing complicated data can often be large enough that you don't want to store them within your program itself
- We can put them in their own file, but reading them in with our current tools would be complicated
	- Current methods read in text, so we would need to _parse_ the text to identify what data structures we needed to create and what elements we needed to add
	- This is certainly possible, but potentially more overhead than what we would like for some structures
- Useful then to store the data structure in file in such a format that it can be easily read into Python

## File I/O
- A variety of ways this can be done
	- XML, YAML, JSON
- JSON is particularly interesting to us, because its syntax almost exactly matches Python's (even though it was made for Javascript)
- Python has a built-in library to read and write JSON files, just called `json`
	- `json.load(file_handle)`
		- Loads the JSON data structure from the specified file into its Python equivalent
	- `json.dump(data_object, file_handle)`
		- Writes a JSON text representation of the data object to the given file
	- Both methods are used inside our normal `with open() as fhandle:` syntax

## Using JSON
- To read a JSON file into a variable `data`:
  ```python
  import json
  with open('file.json') as fh:
	  data = json.load(fh)
  ```
- To write a variable with complex structure out to a JSON file:
  ```python
  import json
  with open('file.json', 'w') as fh:
  	  json.dump(data, fh)
  ```


## The Power of JSON
- One very nice aspect of JSON is that it is often the defacto way that information is passed around the internet
- This means it can be easy to find data providers where you can access or download information already in a JSON format
- DND Fireball Spell info [here](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/spells/fireball)
- We could download this information to a file, which we could then read in and use within our Python program
- Later we'll also look at how we could process the information straight from the internet as well


## JSON Gotchas
- If you are writing JSON files from within Python or using files gotten elsewhere, they should already be properly formatted
- If you need/want to edit a JSON file directly though, you should be aware of a few "gotchas" where the JSON syntax varies _slightly_ from Python's syntax
	- You can **not** have trailing commas at the end of a JSON structure
		- Something like `[1, 2, 3,]` is perfectly fine in Python, but illegal in JSON
	- JSON strings require double quotes
		- In Python you can use either double or single quotes, but JSON requires double
	- Booleans are all lowercase in JSON
		- Vs starting with a capital letter in Python
