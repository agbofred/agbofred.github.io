2. Draw the right and left eyes (both colored black) to be well positioned on the face such that they alighned appropraitely - ***10 points***
3. Draw the right and left pupils (both colored white) and position them so that the left pupil align perfectly to the center of the left eye while the right pupil also align perfectly to the center of the right eye - ***10 points***
4. Draw the nose (a triable shape) colored black and position it at the center of the face - ***10 points***

6. Give a caption _This is an emoji simulation of a pumpkin head!_ to the image which should appear directly below the face and colored green. - ***10 points***

Once you are done with all these tasks, your program should generate an image that looks like this 

![](./images/Emoji_.png){width=450}

__Part #2__

Once you have this picture, add a callback function for the "mousemove" event so that the pupils in the eyes follow the cursor position. For example, if you move the cursor to the lower right side of the screen, the pupils should shift so that they appear to be looking at that point, as shown in the annimation below - ***40 points***
