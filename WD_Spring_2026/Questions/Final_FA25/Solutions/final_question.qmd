### Part 3: Applied Questions (5 Questions)

#### 1. Scenario: Data Processing Pipeline

*A large tech company is designing a complex data processing pipeline where tasks have dependencies (e.g., Task B cannot start until Task A is complete). Some tasks are computationally expensive. The graph structure is known to have millions of nodes (tasks) and a relatively low number of edges (dependencies, M). The goal is to determine a valid sequence in which to run the tasks.*

**Query:**  
a) What specific type of graph structure must this pipeline conform to, and what specialized traversal algorithm should be applied?  
b) Discuss the crucial storage trade-off decision (Adjacency List vs. Matrix) that must be made, justifying the choice based on the structure of the pipeline.

**Answer:**  
a) The pipeline must conform to a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, as cycles would imply a logical deadlock. The required algorithm is **Topological Sort**.  
b) Since the graph is sparse (millions of nodes, few edges), an **Adjacency List** is preferred over an Adjacency Matrix. The matrix would require O(N²) storage, which is prohibitive, while the list requires O(N+M), making it much more memory efficient.

<!-- #### 2. Scenario: Implementing Custom BST Traversal

*A programmer is implementing the inorder method for the LinkedBST class recursively. The requirement is to return an iterator over the data in sorted order.*

**Query:**  
Analyze the provided recursive pseudocode for inorder and explain the function of the internal list `lyst`. Why is it necessary to use `lyst` to collect items recursively before returning an iterator?

**Answer:**  
The list `lyst` acts as a collector for node data in the correct traversal order. Since the method must return an iterator, `lyst` gathers all node data during recursion, and `iter(lyst)` provides the required iterable sequence in sorted order. -->

#### 2. Scenario: Airline Route Mapping

*An airline wants to find the cheapest route between its hub city (S) and all other available cities (V). The cost of flying between any two cities (edges) is always positive. The total number of cities (N) is 100.*

**Query:** Which algorithm—Dijkstra’s or Floyd’s—is appropriate for this task, and what is the computational complexity of the chosen algorithm? Justify your choice based on the problem requirements and time complexity.

**Answer:**  
*Chosen Algorithm:* Dijkstra's Algorithm.  
*Complexity:* O(N²).  
*Justification:* The problem asks for the shortest path from a single source vertex (the hub city S) to all other vertices. Dijkstra's Algorithm is designed specifically to solve the single-source shortest path problem in a weighted graph where edge weights are non-negative. Its complexity is O(N²). Floyd’s Algorithm (Floyd-Warshall) solves the all-pairs shortest path problem, which is overkill for this scenario and has a higher complexity of O(N³). Since the task only requires paths from one hub, Dijkstra’s is more computationally efficient (O(N²) vs O(N³)) while satisfying the requirements.

#### 3. Scenario: Stack-based Maze Solver

*A backtracking algorithm is used to solve a maze. The stack stores the coordinates of alternative paths to explore.*

**Query:**  
If the algorithm reaches a dead end (a location with no adjacent, unvisited spaces), explain the mechanism by which the stack facilitates "backtracking" to an unexplored alternative path.

**Answer:**  
The stack holds coordinates of alternative paths. When a dead end is reached, the algorithm pops locations off the stack until it finds one with unvisited neighbors, thus "backtracking" to the last point of divergence.

---

#### 4. Scenario: Heap Insertion Analysis

*An engineer is evaluating the performance of the add method for a Min-Heap implementation (using an array).*

**Query:**  
Based on the provided add method pseudocode, determine the worst-case time complexity for inserting an item into a heap of size N. Describe the structural event that leads to this worst-case scenario.

**Answer:**  
Worst-case time complexity is **O(logN)**. The worst case occurs when the new item is smaller than all existing items, requiring it to "bubble up" from the leaf to the root, performing swaps at each level.

---

#### 5. Scenario: Directed vs. Undirected Graph Conversion

*A development team has modeled a road network using an Undirected Graph where each edge {u,v} represents a two-way road between city u and city v. A new requirement demands the ability to assign different weights (traffic times) to travel from u to v versus v to u.*

**Query:**  
Explain how the existing undirected graph must be conceptually converted to a Directed Graph (Diagraph) to meet this requirement. Specifically, how many directed edges are needed for every single undirected edge in the original model, and how does this impact the overall edge count (M) for the new representation?

**Answer:**  
Each undirected edge {u,v} must be replaced by **two directed edges**: (u,v) and (v,u), each with its own weight. The total number of edges in the directed graph will be **twice** the original number of undirected edges (2M).
