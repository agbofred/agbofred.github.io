## Database and Table Creation
:::{.small style="font-size: 35px;"}
1.  **Create Database:** In phpMyAdmin, create a new database named `ArtStore`.
2.  **Create Table:** Inside `ArtStore`, create a table named `ArtCollection` with the following fields:
    -   `artID` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
    -   `title` (VARCHAR)
    -   `descr` (TEXT)
    -   `genre` (VARCHAR)
    -   `subject` (VARCHAR)
    -   `size` (VARCHAR)
    -   `year` (YEAR)
    -   `museum` (VARCHAR)
:::

## Data Insertion and Validation

-   **Method:** Use the `POST` method in your HTML form.
-   **Validation:** Implement validation for each form field using HTML5 attributes and/or PHP/JavaScript to ensure data integrity.
-   **Query:** Use a PHP `INSERT` statement to add the validated form data into the `ArtCollection` table.
