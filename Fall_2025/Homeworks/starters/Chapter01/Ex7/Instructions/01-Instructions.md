Statisticians would like to have a set of functions to compute the median and mode of a list of numbers. 
The **median** is the number that would appear at the midpoint of a list if it were sorted. 
The **mode** is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Also include a function named **mean**, which computes the average of a set of numbers. The `main()` has been provided for you. Define the three functions `median`, `mode`, `mean` in a module named _stats.py_.
Each function expects a list of numbers as an argument and returns a single number. Your program's output should look like the following: 

```
Mode: 2
Median: 2
Mean: 2
```
