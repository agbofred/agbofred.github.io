1. Why do you choose the particular python datastructure for your bad implementation?




2. What is the time complexity (Big-O notation) for the key operations:
    (a) add
    
    (b) remove
    
    (c) count
    
    (d) length 
    
    (e) contains

3. Reflect and describe two real-world use cases or scenarios where a Bag data structure would be a more suitable choice than a standard list, set, or dictionary.


4. Suggest one or two additional features or methods that would enhance the functionality of your Bag class (e.g., a method to find the most frequent item, a way to combine two bags, etc). Describe how would you implement your suggestion(s).
