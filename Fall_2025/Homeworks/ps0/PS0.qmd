The question on this first problem set 0 is to get you started to be sure you are good with all the installations and ready for the main assignments. It also allow you to run through the process of submitting assignments in this class through GitHub Classroom.  The question has template files in the repository. You’ll need to grab the assignment from the link below and download the entire folder to your computer before proceeding. I would highly suggest then opening the entire folder in VS Code, as it will make it very easy to edit the different files and is necessary for VS Code to find certain libraries. When you are finished, upload your completed templates back to GitHub. Don’t worry about changing any file names, you want to overwrite the original template files.

# Problem 1
Write a program that takes the radius of a sphere (a floating-point number) as input and outputs the sphere’s diameter, circumference, surface area, and volume.


# Problem 2
An employee’s total weekly pay equals the hourly wage multiplied by the total number of regular hours plus any overtime pay. Overtime pay equals the total overtime hours multiplied by 1.5 times the hourly wage. Write a program that takes as inputs the hourly wage, total regular hours, and total overtime hours and displays an employee’s total weekly pay.
