## Normal Data Types
- Defining new data types through classes is commonly used to represent objects to be manipulated by the program
- Examples:
    - A letter cell in Wordle: stores the graphical portrayal of the cell, as well as tools to interact with the cell (changing color or letter)
    - A ball in Breakout: stores the ball position and graphics, as well as tools to handle movement and bouncing
- We define these classes to make it easier to write the later code governing the overall program

## Abstract Data Types
- An alternative use of classes though is to represent a little machine that allows us to more easily perform certain actions
    - The created objects themselves are not important to the program. Only the result of their computations.
- Types that are defined largely by their behavior this way are called ***abstract data types*** or ***ADT***s

## Why ADTs?
- ***Simplicity*** – The internal representation is hidden from the client when used.

> “I don’t need to know how a car works to drive from my home to work.”

- ***Flexibility*** – If the internal representation needs to be changed by the programmer, they can do so without breaking outside compatibility.


> “My mechanic could install new brakes, and I’d still drive the car in the same way.”

- ***Security*** – Keeping the internal representation away from clients prevents clients from directly altering values that may cause the type to behave unexpectedly.


> “My engine is not exposed to the outside world, where anyone could muck with it.”

## Creating ADTs
- As ADTs accomplish or facilitate a task, we need to understand what task we are hoping to accomplish
    - The most useful ADTs are often not correlated to a specific program. They could work in any program.
- With task in mind, what would be useful to a person trying to accomplish that task?
    - These are commonly the methods that we need to define
- What internal values will we need to track to accomplish these tasks or interactions?
    - These will likely be the attributes that we need to define

## Chop Chop
- Hearken back to our Pig Latin translation program from earlier this semester
    - `word_to_pig_latin` took a single word and translated into Pig Latin
    - To translate an entire sentence, we would need code to break the sentence up into individual words, which we could then pass into word_to_pig_latin
- The latter is an example of something that comes up often in computer science: breaking a larger thing into particular smaller chunks
    - These “chunks” can really be anything, so the more general term computer scientists use is a ***token***
    - Breaking up a larger thing into smaller tokens would be a useful task to accomplish!



## A Token Scanner
- A class that plucked out individual tokens might be called a token scanner or token extractor
- What would a client want from a token scanner?
    - A way to pass in the necessary input
    - A way to retrieve the next individual token
    - A way to know when there are no more tokens
    - Maybe a way to tailor or fine-tune what tokens are desired
- These requirements help inform what methods should be incorporated into a token scanner class!
    - Still need to determine what internal attributes might be needed


## Token Scanner Methods
- Exports 4 main methods:
    1. `scanner.set_input(str)`
        - Sets the input of the token scanner to the specified string or input stream
    2. `scanner.next_token()`
        - Returns the next token from the scanner text, or `""` at the end
    3. `scanner.has_more_tokens()`
        - Returns `True` if more tokens exist, `False` otherwise
    4. `scanner.ignore_whitespace()`
        - Customization option which tells the scanner to ignore whitespace characters

## Token Scanner Attributes
- What will we need to track to implement these methods?
    - What the main text is
    - Where we are currently at within the text
    - A boolean flag to indicate if we should be ignoring whitespace
- These will generally be defined within our constructor function (or in a function called from the constructor)

## Walkthrough Token Scanner: Ch 10.5 

``` {.python data-line-numbers="1|48,49,50,51,52,53|57,58,59,60,61,62,63|65-80|82-88|90-94|98-103" style='min-height:900px; font-size: 30px'}
# A token scanner is an abstract data type that divides a string into
# individual tokens, which are strings of consecutive characters that
# form logical units.  This simplified version recognizes two token types:
#
#   1. A string of consecutive letters and digits
#   2. A single character string
#
# To use this class, you must first create a TokenScanner instance by
# calling its constructor:
#
#     scanner = TokenScanner()
#
# The next step is to call the set_input method to specify the string
# from which tokens are read, as follows:
#
#     scanner.set_input(s)
#
# Once you have initialized the scanner, you can retrieve the next token
# by calling
#
#    token = scanner.next_token()
#
# To determine whether any tokens remain to be read, you can either
# call the predicate method scanner.has_more_tokens() or check to see
# whether next_token returns the empty string.
#
# The following code fragment serves as a pattern for processing each
# token in the string stored in the variable source:
#
#     scanner = TokenScanner(source)
#     while scanner.has_more_tokens():
#         token = scanner.next_token()
#         . . . code to process the token . . .
#
# By default, the TokenScanner class treats whitespace characters
# as operators and returns them as single-character tokens.  You
# can set the token scanner to ignore whitespace characters by
# making the following call:
#
#     scanner.ignore_whitespace()

## Using `TokenScanner`
- __Need to initialize the token scanner object__
    - You need to create the machine before you can use it
-  Feed the machine the text you want to grab tokens from
- Generally, keep looping as long as there are still tokens
    - Each iteration, get the latest token and then do something with it

## Using `TokenScanner` in `PigLatin`

```{.python style='min-height:900px; font-size: 40px'}

from tokenscanner import TokenScanner

def to_pig_latin(text):
    translation = ""
    scanner = TokenScanner()
    scanner.set_input(text)
    while scanner.has_more_tokens():
        token = scanner.next_token()
        if token.isalpha():
            token = word_to_pig_latin(token)
        translation += token
    return translation


```
