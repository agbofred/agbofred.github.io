# Oral Exam Version A

## Conceptual Questions (20 pts each)

1. **Describe how collisions are handled in a hash map that uses a fixed-size array with linked list chains. Why is this method used, and what are its trade-offs?**

2. **Explain what properties a good hash function should have. How might poor hash function design affect the performance of a hash map?**

3. **Analyze the best-case and worst-case time complexity of searching for a key in a hash map. What conditions lead to each?**

## Applied Use Case (40 pts)

Imagine you're designing an app for scheduling tutoring appointments in the Academic Support Center. Would a hash map be a good choice for organizing appointments by student ID? Justify your answer.

1. **Describe how collisions are handled in a hash map that uses a fixed-size array with linked list chains. Why is this method used, and what are its trade-offs?**

2. **Explain what properties a good hash function should have. How might poor hash function design affect the performance of a hash map?**

3. **Analyze the best-case, average-case, and worst-case time complexity of searching for a key in a hash map. What conditions lead to each?**

## Applied Use Case (40 pts)

Suppose you're building a lost-and-found database for Willamette University where items are stored by location found (e.g., Sparks, Ford, Montag). Would a hash map be effective? Explain how youâ€™d structure the keys and values.

## Applied Use Case (40 pts)

You're creating a meal-tracking app for Goudy Commons that maps student IDs to their recent meal check-ins. Would a hash map be appropriate here? Explain how you'd use it and any challenges that might arise.
