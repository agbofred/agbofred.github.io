## üß∫ Bag (Multi-Set)

**Operations:**

- What typical operations does a Bag support?
- Speak to the mutability of the items in a Bag.

**Complexity:**

- What is the time complexity of a `get()` method in an array-based Bag?
- What is the complexity of checking if a Bag contains an item?

**Comparisons:**

- How is a Bag different from a Set or List?
- When would you use a Bag instead of a List?

**Scenarios:**

- Is a Bag a good choice if you need to keep items sorted? 
- Would a Bag be useful for counting duplicate votes?

## üì¶ Array

**Operations:**

- How do you insert an item at index i in an array?
- What happens when you access an index out of range?

**Complexity:**

- What is the time complexity of accessing an array element? (O(1))
- What is the complexity of inserting at the beginning of an array? (O(n))

**Comparisons:**

- Why is an array faster for access than a linked list?
- What are the drawbacks of fixed-size arrays?

**Scenarios:**

- Is an array a good choice for a list of student IDs? (Yes, if fixed)
- Would you use an array for a dynamic playlist? (No, unless resizable)

## üìê Array2D

**Operations:**

- How would you access or update a cell in a 2D array?
- How could you initialize a 2D grid with default values?

**Complexity:**

- What is the time complexity of accessing a single cell? 
- What is the complexity of filling an entire grid? 

**Comparisons:**

- When would you use an Array2D over a flat array?

**Scenarios:**

- Is Array2D good for representing game boards? (Yes)
- Would Array2D be efficient for sparse data? (No)

## üîó Doubly LinkedList

**Operations:**

- Describe the append process.
- Descrbe the process of inserting a node in the middle.


**Complexity:**

- What is the time complexity of inserting at the front? 
- What is the complexity of searching for a value? 

**Comparisons:**

- How does LinkedList compare to Array for insertions?
- If a LinkedList supported bracket operators, what is the complexity of accessing an element compared to an Array?

**Scenarios:**

- Is LinkedList a good choice for a large, frequently modified list? 
- Is it good for random access?

\newpage 


## ü•û Stacks

**Operations:**

- Describe what `push()` and `pop()` do in a stack?
- How would you implement `peek()`?

**Complexity:**

- What is the time complexity of `push` and `pop`?

**Comparisons:**

- Why would you choose a Linked List stack over an Array-based stack?
- Which is more memory efficient: array stack or linked list stack?

**Scenarios:**

- Describe an everyday use case for a stack.
-

## Queues

**Operations:**

- How does `enqueue` work in a CircularQueue?
- How do you detect if the queue is full or empty?

**Complexity:**

- What is the time complexity of `enqueue` and `dequeue` in a CircularQueue?
- What is the time complexity of `enqueue` and `dequeue` in an Array-based Queue?

**Comparisons:**

- Why is modulo used in fixed-size circular structures?


**Scenarios:**

- Would a CircularQueue be good for a printer queue?
- Is a Queue a good choice for implementing Undo functionality? 

\newpage 


## üåÄ Deque (Linked List-based)

**Operations:**

- 

**Complexity:**

- What is the time complexity of operations at both ends? 

**Comparisons:**

- Why is a Deque more flexible than a Stack or Queue?
- Is a linked list Deque better than an array Deque for many insertions? 

**Scenarios:**

- Should Deques be used for fast random access?
- Is a Deque a good choice for implementing a browser history?


\newpage 


## üß† HashMap (Array[LinkedList[Tuple]])

**Operations:**

- Explain the purpose of a hash function and what makes a hash function `good`?

**Complexity:**

- What is the average time complexity of `__getitem__()`? 
- What is the worst-case time for a badly distributed hash function?

**Comparisons:**

- How does a HashMap compare to a list for lookup?

**Scenarios:**

- Is a HashMap good for storing and retrieving user accounts by ID? 
- Should you use a HashMap when maintaining insertion order matters?
