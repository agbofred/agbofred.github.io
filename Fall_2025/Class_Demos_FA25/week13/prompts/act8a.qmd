1. The course prerequisites for a computer science major at a local college are numbered as follows: 111 is required for 112 and 210; 112 is required for 312, 313, 209, and 211; and 210 is required for 312. Draw a directed graph that represents this numbering structure.

2.  a) How many edges are in a `complete`, `undirected` graph with six vertices?

2. b) Draw a graph that represents the description in 2a above.

3. Make a table showing the `adjacency matrix` for the following directed graph with edge costs.

4. Draw a picture showing the `adjacency list` for the above-directed graph with edge costs. You should assume that the edges in a list are ordered from least cost to greatest cost.

5. State one advantage and one disadvantage of the adjacency matrix representation and the adjacency list representation of graphs.
