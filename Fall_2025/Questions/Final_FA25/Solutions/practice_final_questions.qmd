### Part 3: Applied Questions (5 Questions)

#### 1. Scenario: Social Media Connectivity

*A software company is modeling user relationships on a new social media platform. They initially used an Adjacency Matrix to represent the "following" relationship. However, they observed that 98% of users follow less than 100 other users, but the platform has millions of users (N is very large).*

**Query:** Explain the performance and storage trade-off implications of using the Adjacency Matrix in this scenario, and recommend the superior alternative representation.

**Answer:**  
*Trade-off Explanation:* The Adjacency Matrix always requires N² storage cells, regardless of the number of actual edges (relationships, M). Since the graph is sparse (98% of users follow relatively few others, meaning M ≪ N²), most cells in the matrix will be unused (containing 0), leading to massive memory waste (high storage cost). Although checking for an edge between two specific users is O(1), iterating across all neighbors of a specific user is slow, requiring O(N) time per row.  
*Recommendation:* The Adjacency List is the superior choice. For a sparse graph, the adjacency list requires memory proportional to N (for the array of pointers) plus 2M (for edges in an undirected graph, or M for directed). Given M is small relative to N², the memory consumption is drastically lower. Furthermore, iterating across all neighbors of a given vertex is faster with an adjacency list, scaling with the actual number of neighbors, not N.

#### 2. Scenario: Compiler Optimization

*A compiler is processing a complex arithmetic expression: ((4 + 5) * 6) - 3.*

**Query:** Describe the sequence of steps a stack-based algorithm would perform to evaluate the Postfix equivalent of this expression. Use only the operators and operands from the expression above. Explain what happens to the stack when the first operator * is encountered in the Postfix evaluation process.

**Answer:**  
First, the infix expression ((4 + 5) * 6) - 3 must be converted to postfix (which is `4 5 + 6 * 3 -`).  
**Postfix Evaluation Steps:**
1. Scan 4: Push 4 onto the stack.
2. Scan 5: Push 5 onto the stack.
3. Scan +: Pop 5, Pop 4. Calculate 4+5=9. Push 9.
4. Scan 6: Push 6 onto the stack.
5. Scan *: (First encounter of the operator) Pop 6 (operand 2), Pop 9 (operand 1). Calculate 9*6=54. Push 54.
6. Scan 3: Push 3 onto the stack.
7. Scan -: Pop 3 (operand 2), Pop 54 (operand 1). Calculate 54−3=51. Push 51.
8. End of expression: The result (51) is the final item on the stack.

#### 3. Scenario: Airline Route Mapping

*An airline wants to find the cheapest route between its hub city (S) and all other available cities (V). The cost of flying between any two cities (edges) is always positive. The total number of cities (N) is 100.*

**Query:** Which algorithm—Dijkstra’s or Floyd’s—is appropriate for this task, and what is the computational complexity of the chosen algorithm? Justify your choice based on the problem requirements and time complexity.

**Answer:**  
*Chosen Algorithm:* Dijkstra's Algorithm.  
*Complexity:* O(N²).  
*Justification:* The problem asks for the shortest path from a single source vertex (the hub city S) to all other vertices. Dijkstra's Algorithm is designed specifically to solve the single-source shortest path problem in a weighted graph where edge weights are non-negative. Its complexity is O(N²). Floyd’s Algorithm (Floyd-Warshall) solves the all-pairs shortest path problem, which is overkill for this scenario and has a higher complexity of O(N³). Since the task only requires paths from one hub, Dijkstra’s is more computationally efficient (O(N²) vs O(N³)) while satisfying the requirements.

#### 4. Scenario: Emergency Room Scheduling

*You are designing the ERModel for an Emergency Room Scheduler system, which must manage patients based on priority (Critical=1, Serious=2, Fair=3).*

**Query:** If you use a LinkedPriorityQueue implementation based on a sorted linked list, how does the add method ensure that a new patient item is placed correctly? If the queue currently holds [Patient_A (1), Patient_B (2), Patient_C (2), Patient_D (3)], where would a new patient, Patient_E (2), be inserted, and why?

**Answer:**  
*Add Method Implementation Strategy:* The LinkedPriorityQueue implementation, based on a sorted list, requires overriding the standard add method. The add method conducts a search for the new item's position. It iterates through the list, finding the correct insertion point such that the list remains sorted by priority (where smaller rank means higher priority). The new item is inserted ahead of items of lesser priority (higher rank) or after items of greater or equal priority (lower rank).  
*Insertion of Patient_E (2):* Patient_E (2) has a lower priority (higher rank number) than Patient_A (1). It has the same priority as Patient_B (2) and Patient_C (2). Patient_E would be inserted after Patient_C (2). Items of equal priority are removed in FIFO order. To maintain this FIFO order among equal priorities, the new patient (E) must be placed at the rear of the existing patients with that same priority (B and C).  
*New Queue Order:* [Patient_A (1), Patient_B (2), Patient_C (2), Patient_E (2), Patient_D (3)].

#### 5. Scenario: Tree Structure Verification

*A student has implemented the LinkedBST class and wants to check its integrity by analyzing the visitation order of nodes. The tree contains nodes labeled 10, 5, 15, 3, 7, 12, 18.*

**Query:** Provide the expected node visitation order for the Inorder Traversal and explain why this traversal is particularly useful for verifying a Binary Search Tree (BST).

**Answer:**  
*Inorder Traversal Definition:* Inorder traversal visits the left subtree, then the root node, then the right subtree.  
*Expected Inorder Visitation Order:* 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 18.  
*Utility for BST Verification:* In a Binary Search Tree (BST), the keys in the left subtree are smaller than the root, and the keys in the right subtree are larger than the root. When an Inorder Traversal is performed on a valid BST, the data retrieved is always guaranteed to be in ascending (sorted) order. Therefore, running an Inorder Traversal is the standard way to verify that a tree structure correctly maintains the BST property.
