### Part 2: Short Answer Questions (1-2 Words) (10 Questions)

*Write your answer in 1-2 words.*

1. What term is used to describe the index variable that points to the logical end of an array-based queue in an implementation where items are not shifted left upon removal?

### Part 3: Applied Questions (5 Questions)

#### 1. Scenario: Data Processing Pipeline

*A large tech company is designing a complex data processing pipeline where tasks have dependencies (e.g., Task B cannot start until Task A is complete). Some tasks are computationally expensive. The graph structure is known to have millions of nodes (tasks) and a relatively low number of edges (dependencies, M). The goal is to determine a valid sequence in which to run the tasks.*

**Query:**  
a) What specific type of graph structure must this pipeline conform to, and what specialized traversal algorithm should be applied?  
b) Discuss the crucial storage trade-off decision (Adjacency List vs. Matrix) that must be made, justifying the choice based on the structure of the pipeline.

---

#### 2. Scenario: Implementing Custom BST Traversal

*A programmer is implementing the inorder method for the LinkedBST class recursively. The requirement is to return an iterator over the data in sorted order.*

**Query:**  
Analyze the provided recursive pseudocode for inorder and explain the function of the internal list `lyst`. Why is it necessary to use `lyst` to collect items recursively before returning an iterator?

---

#### 3. Scenario: Stack-based Maze Solver

*A backtracking algorithm is used to solve a maze. The stack stores the coordinates of alternative paths to explore.*

**Query:**  
If the algorithm reaches a dead end (a location with no adjacent, unvisited spaces), explain the mechanism by which the stack facilitates "backtracking" to an unexplored alternative path.

---

#### 4. Scenario: Heap Insertion Analysis

*An engineer is evaluating the performance of the add method for a Min-Heap implementation (using an array).*

**Query:**  
Based on the provided add method pseudocode, determine the worst-case time complexity for inserting an item into a heap of size N. Describe the structural event that leads to this worst-case scenario.

---

#### 5. Scenario: Directed vs. Undirected Graph Conversion

*A development team has modeled a road network using an Undirected Graph where each edge {u,v} represents a two-way road between city u and city v. A new requirement demands the ability to assign different weights (traffic times) to travel from u to v versus v to u.*

**Query:**  
Explain how the existing undirected graph must be conceptually converted to a Directed Graph (Diagraph) to meet this requirement. Specifically, how many directed edges are needed for every single undirected edge in the original model, and how does this impact the overall edge count (M) for the new representation?
