## An Overview of Trees
:::{.incremental}
- A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure consisting of items called `nodes`, with a single node designated as the root.
- Ideas of `predecessor` and `successor` are replaced with `parent` and `child`
- Each node may have zero or more child nodes.
- There are no cycles; each child has exactly one parent (except the root, which has none).

## Tree Terminology (example)

![](../images/TreesTerminology.png){style="width:85%;"}


## General Trees and Binary Trees 
- General tree
    - Above is an example of a general Tree
- Binary tree
    - Each node has at most two children
    - Children are referred to as the left child and the right child


## General Trees and Binary Trees 

![](../images/unequalBinaryTree.png){style="width:85%;"}


- Two unequal binary trees that have the same sets of nodes shown here 
    - Are not the same when they are considered `binary` trees
    - Are the same when they are considered `general` trees

## Recursive Definitions of Trees

- **General tree**  
    A general tree is either empty or consists of a finite set of nodes $T$.  
    - One node $r$ is distinguished from all others and is called the **root**.
    - The set $T - \{r\}$ is partitioned into disjoint subsets, each of which is itself a general tree.

- **Binary tree**  
    A binary tree is either empty or consists of a **root** plus a **left subtree** and a **right subtree**, each of which is a binary tree.

## Why Use a Tree? 
- Trees nicely represent hierarchical structures
- Parse tree
    - Describes the syntactic structure of a sentence in terms of its components
    - Such as noun phrases and verb phrases
    - See Figure on the next slide
- File system structures are also tree-like

## Why Use a Tree: Parse Tree
![](../images/parseTree.png){style="width:90%;"}

- A parse tree for a sentence ***The girl hit the ball with a bat***


## Why Use a Tree: File System
![](../images/filesystemTree.png){style="width:90%;"}

- A file system structure indicating `D` as directory (now folder) and `F` as file


## Why Use a Tree: Binary Sorted
![](../images/SortedBinaryTree.png){style="width:90%;"}

- A binary representation of a sorted collection that contains the letters A through G (Also called ***Binary Search Tree - BST***)

## The Shape of Binary Trees 
- Trees as data structures come in various shapes and sizes
    - Some are vine-like and some are bushy
- The shape of a binary tree can be described by specifying the relationship between its height and the number of nodes it contains
    - A binary tree can be vine-like with `N` nodes and a height of `N − 1`
    - A full binary tree contains the full complement of nodes at each level

## The Shape of Binary Trees 
:::{.incremental style="font-size: 30px;"}
![](../images/shapeOfBinaryTree.png){style="width:90%;"}

- A **vine-like tree** is a binary tree where each node has at most one child, resulting in a structure similar to a linked list (maximum height, minimum bushiness).
- A **bushy tree** is a binary tree where nodes have two children as often as possible, resulting in a more balanced and compact structure (minimum height, maximum bushiness).

## The Shape of Binary Trees 
:::{.smaller style="font-size: 30px;"}
- The Relationship Between the `Height` and the `Number` of `Nodes` in Full Binary Tree

| Height (h) | Minimum Nodes | Maximum Nodes (Full Binary Tree) |
|------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| 0          | 1             | 1                                |
| 1          | 2             | 3                                |
| 2          | 3             | 7                                |
| 3          | 4             | 15                               |
| h          | h + 1         | 2^(h+1) - 1                      |

- In a full binary tree of height `h`, the maximum number of nodes is `2^(h+1) - 1`.
- The minimum number of nodes in a binary tree of height `h` is `h + 1` (vine-like tree).

:::

## The Shape of Binary Trees 

- Not all bushy trees are full binary trees
    - However, a perfectly balanced binary tree, is bushy enough to support worst-case logarithmic access to leaf nodes
- A complete binary tree, in which any nodes on the last level are filled in from left to right, is, like a full binary tree
    - A special case of a perfectly balanced binary tree

## The Shape of Binary Trees 

![](../images/TypeofBinaryTree.png){style="width:90%;"}

- Four types of shapes of binary trees

## Binary Tree Traversals
- Four standard types of traversals for binary trees:
    - Preorder
    - Inorder
    - Postorder
    - Level order
- Each type follows a particular path and direction as it visits the nodes in the tree


## Binary Tree: Preorder Traversals
- **Preorder traversal** visits nodes in the following order:
    1. Visit the root node.
    2. Traverse the left subtree in preorder.
    3. Traverse the right subtree in preorder.

- **Pseudocode:**

    ```{.python}
    Preorder(node):
        if node is not null:
            visit(node)
            Preorder(node.left)
            Preorder(node.right)
    ```

## Binary Tree: Preorder Traversals
- **Example:**  
For the tree below, the preorder traversal order is: **D, B, A, C, F, E, G**

![](../images/preorderTraversal.png){style="width:60%;"}


## Binary Tree: Inorder Traversals
- **Inorder traversal** visits nodes in the following order:
    1. Traverse the left subtree in inorder.
    2. Visit the root node.
    3. Traverse the right subtree in inorder.

- **Pseudocode:**
```{.python}
Inorder(node):
    if node is not null:
        Inorder(node.left)
        visit(node)
        Inorder(node.right)
```
## Binary Tree: Inorder Traversals
- **Example:**  
  For the tree below, the inorder traversal order is: **A, B, C, D, E, F, G**

  ![](../images/inorderTraversal.png){style="width:60%;"}


## Binary Tree: Postorder Traversals 
- **Postorder traversal** visits nodes in the following order:
    1. Traverse the left subtree in postorder.
    2. Traverse the right subtree in postorder.
    3. Visit the root node.

- **Pseudocode:** 
```{.python}
Postorder(node):
    if node is not null:
        Postorder(node.left)
        Postorder(node.right)
        visit(node)
```

## Binary Tree: Postorder Traversals
- **Example:**  
  For the tree below, the postorder traversal order is: **A, C, B, E, G, F, D**

  ![](../images/postorderTraversal.png){style="width:60%;"}


## Binary Tree: Level Order Traversals

- **Level order traversal** visits nodes level by level from top to bottom and left to right within each level.
- This traversal uses a queue data structure.

- **Pseudocode:**
```{.python}
LevelOrder(root):
    if root is not null:
        for each level from 0 to height of tree:
            visit all nodes at that level from left to right
```

## Binary Tree: Level Order Traversals
- **Example:**  
  For the tree below, the level order traversal order is: **D, B, F, A, C, E, G**
