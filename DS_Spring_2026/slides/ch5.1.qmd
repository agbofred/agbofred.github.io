# Linked Structures 

## Learning Objectives 
- Create linked structures using singly linked nodes
- Perform various operations on linked structures with singly linked nodes
- Describe how costs and benefits of operations on linked structures depend on how they are represented in computer memory
- Compare the trade-offs in running time and memory usage of linked structures

## Linked Structures
:::{.incremental}
- A **linked structure** is another way to organize data in your program
- Just like array, it is a commonly used data structure to implement many types of collections
- This section covers characteristics that programmers must keep in mind when using linked. structures to implement any type of collection.
:::

## Linked Structures
:::{.incremental}
- Each element in a linked structure is called a **node**.
- Every node contains:
    - The `data` (or value) it stores.
    - A `reference` (or pointer/link) to the next node in the sequence.
- The first node is called the **head** of the list.
- The last node points to `None` (or null), indicating the end of the structure.

:::

## Linked Structures
:::{.incremental}
- Linked structures do not require contiguous memory; nodes can be scattered throughout memory.
- Linked structures allow for efficient insertion and removal of elements at arbitrary positions, without shifting other elements.
- Insertion and deletion operations are efficient, especially at the beginning of the structure.
- Accessing an element by position requires traversing the structure from the head node.
::: 

## Types of Linked Structure
:::{.incremental}
- Common types of linked structures include:
    - Singly linked lists
    - Doubly linked lists
    - Circular linked lists
- The most basic linked structure is the **singly linked list**, where each node points to the next node.
- Linked structures are fundamental for implementing other data structures such as stacks, queues, and more complex structures like trees and graphs.
:::

## Singly Linked Structure 
:::{.incremental style="font-size:30px;"}
- It is useful to draw diagrams of linked structures using a box and pointer notation 
- A user of a singly linked structure accesses the first item by following a single external head link:
    - User then accesses other items by chaining through the single links that emanate from the items
    - Easy to get the successor of an item
    - Not so easy to get to the predecessor of an item

- ![](../images/singlyLinked.png){}

:::

## Doubly Linked Structure 
:::{.incremental style="font-size:30px;"}
- A doubly linked structure contains links running in both directions:
    - A second external link, called the `tail link`, allows the user of a doubly linked structure to access the last item directly 
- The last item in either type of linked structure has no link to the next item:
    - Figure indicates the absence of a link, called an `empty link`, by means of a slash instead of an arrow


- ![](../images/doublyLinked.png){style="width:100%"}
:::

## Doubly Linked Structure 
:::{.incremental style="font-size:32px;"}
- A programmer who uses a linked structure **cannot** immediately access an item by specifying its index position:
    - Programmer must start at one end of the structure and follow the links until the desired position (item) is reached
- The way in which memory is allocated for linked structures is unlike that of arrays and has two important consequences for insertion and removal operations:
    - Once an insertion or removal point has been found, the insertion or removal can take place with no shifting of data items in memory
    - The linked structure can be resized during each insertion or removal with no extra memory cost and no copying of data items
:::


## Noncontiguous Memory and Nodes 
:::{.smaller style="font-size:30px;"}
- A linked structure decouples the logical sequence of items in the structure from any ordering in memory:
    - **Noncontiguous memory**: The cell for a given item in a linked structure can be found anywhere in memory.
- Basic unit of representation in a linked structure is a `node`
    - A singly linked node contains the following components or fields:
        - A data item
        - A link to the next node in the structure (a doubly linked node contains a link to the previous node in the structure as well)
        - ![](../images/nodes.png){style="width:25%"}
:::

## Linked Structure and Array Rep

- This figure shows a linked structure and its array representation
![](../images/linkedArray.png){style="width:100%"}

## Memory Address
- In more modern languages the programmer has direct access to the addresses of data in the form of ***pointers***:
    - A `node` in a singly linked structure contains a data item and a pointer value

- Python programmers set up nodes and linked structures by using references to objects:
    - Programmers define a singly linked node by defining an object that contains two fields: a reference to a data item and a reference to another node

## Singly Linked Node Class

```{.python}
# Code for a singly linked node class:
class Node(object):
    """Represents a singly linked node."""
    def __init__(self, data, next = None):
        """Instantiates a Node with a default next of None."""
        self.data = data
        self.next = next
```
- Node variables are initialized to either the None value or a new Node object
- Code segment that shows some variations on these two options:

```{.python}
# Using the Singly Linked Node Class 
node1 = None                # Just an empty link    
node2 = Node("A", None)     # A node containing data and an empty link
node3 = Node("B", node2)    # A node containing data and a link to node2

```

## Using the Singly Linked Node Class
- Figure below show the state of the three variables after the code in previous slide is run
    - Three external links

![](../images/coderun.png){style="width:100%"}

## Using the Singly Linked Node Class
- Suppose you attempt to place the first node at the beginning of the linked structure that already contains `node2` and `node3` by running the following statement:
```node1.next = node3```
- Python responds by raising an `AttributeError`
- To create the desired link, you could run either

```{.python} 
node1 = Node("C", node3) 
```
or
```{.python}
node1 = Node("C", None)
node1.next = node3
```

## Using the Singly Linked Node Class
:::{.smaller style="font-size:37px;"}
:::{.notes}
- Note the following points about this program:
- One pointer, `head`, generates the linked structure. This pointer is manipulated in such a
    - way that the most recently inserted item is always at the beginning of the structure.
- Thus, when the data are displayed, they appear in the reverse order of their insertion.
- Also, when the data are displayed, the head pointer is reset to the next node, until the head pointer becomes None. Thus, at the end of this process, the nodes are effectively deleted from the linked structure. They are no longer available to the program and are
recycled during the next garbage collection.
:::
- Linked structures are processed with loops: Use loops to create a linked structure and visit each node in it
- Code to create a singly linked structure and print its contents:

```{.python}
"""
File: testnode.py
Tests the Node class.
"""
from node import Node
head = None
# Add five nodes to the beginning of the linked structure
for count in range(1, 6):
    head = Node(count, head)
# Print the contents of the structure
while head != None:
    print(head.data)
    head = head.next

```
:::

## Knowledge Check!
:::{.notes}
- if the programmer attempts to access a node's data when the node reference variable is refers to Noon, Python will flag `AttributeError`. 
- How to fix, 
`if nodeVariable != None:`
    `<access a field in nodeVariable>`

- to copy full array into a linked structure:
```{.python}
head = None
i = len(array) - 1
while i >= 0:
    head = Node(array[i], head)
    i -= 1

```
:::
:::{.incremental}
1. Using box and pointer notation, draw a picture of the nodes created by the first loop in the tester program.
2. What happens when a programmer attempts to access a node’s data fields when the node variable refers to None? How do you guard against it?
3. Write a code segment that transfers items from a full array to a singly linked structure. The operation should preserve the ordering of the items.
:::

## Operations on Singly Linked Structures
- The programmer must emulate index-based operations on a linked structure by manipulating links within the structure
- This section covers how these manipulations are performed in common operations, such as
    - Traversals
    - Insertions
    - Removals

## Traversals Linked Structures
- Traversal
    - Uses a temporary pointer variable named probe
    - This variable is initialized to the linked structure’s head pointer and then controls a loop as follows:
```{.python}
probe = head
while probe != None:
    <use or modify probe.data>
probe = probe.next
```

## Traversal Linked Structures

- Figure shows the state of the pointer variables `probe` and head during each pass of the loop
    - Traversing a linked structure

        - ![](../images/traversal.png){style="width:50%"}

## Searching Linked Structures
- The sequential search of a linked structure resembles a traversal:
    - You must start at the first node and follow the links until you reach a sentinel
- Two possible sentinels
    - The empty link, indicating there are no more data items to examine
    - A data item that equals the target item, indicating a successful search

## Searching Linked Structures
:::{.smaller style="font-size:33px;"}
- The form of the search for a given item:
```{.python}
probe = head
while probe != None and targetItem != probe.data:
    probe = probe.next
if probe != None:
    <targetItem has been found>
else:
    <targetItem is not in the linked structure>
```
- Accessing the ith item of a linked structure is also a sequential search operation
- Here is the form for accessing the ith item:

```{.python}
# Assumes 0 <= index < n
probe = head
while index > 0:
    probe = probe.next
    index -= 1
return probe.data
```
:::

## Replacement Operations of Linked Structures
- Replacement operations also employ the traversal pattern:
    - Search for a given item or position in the linked structure and replace the item with a new item
- The form of the operation:
```{.python}
# Assumes 0 <= index < n
probe = head
while probe != None and targetItem != probe.data:
    probe = probe.next
if probe != None:
    probe.data = newItem
    return True
else:
    return False
```

## Replacement Operations of Linked Structures
- The operation to replace the ith item assumes that 0 <= i < n
- Here is the form:
```{.python}
# Assumes 0 <= index < n
probe = head
while index > 0:
    probe = probe.next
    index -= 1
probe.data = newItem

```

## Inserting at the Beginning
:::{.smaller style="font-size: 30px;"}
- The form:
    `head = Node(newItem, head)`
- Figure below traces this operation for two cases:
    - The pointer is None in the first case, so the item is inserted into the structure
    - In the second case, the second item is inserted at the beginning of the same structure
        - ![](../images/insertatBeginning.png){style="width:70%"}
:::


## Inserting at the End
:::{.smaller style="font-size: 35px;"}
- Inserting an item at the end of a singly linked structure must consider two cases:
    - The head pointer is None, so the head pointer is set to the new node
    - The head pointer is not None, so the code searches for the last node and aims its next pointer at the new node
- The second case returns you to the traversal pattern. Here is the form:

```{.python}
newNode = Node(newItem)
if head is None:
    head = newNode
else:
    probe = head
while probe.next != None:
    probe = probe.next
probe.next = newNode
```
:::

## Inserting at the End 
:::{.smaller style="font-size: 35px;"}
- Inserting an item at the end of a linked structure
    - ![](../images/insertLinkedEnd.png){style="width:75%"}
:::


## Removing at the Beginning
:::{.smaller style="font-size: 32px;"}
- To remove an item at the beginning of a linked structure, here is the form:

```{.python}
# Assumes at least one node in the structure
removedItem = head.data
head = head.next
return removedItem
```
- ![](../images/removeLinkedbeginning.png){style="width:70%"}
:::


## Removing at the End 
:::{.smaller style="font-size: 35px;"}
- Removing an item at the end of a singly linked structure assumes at least one node in the structure
- Two cases to consider
    - There is just one node and the head pointer is set to None
    - There is a node before the last node and the code searches for this second-to-last node and sets its next pointer to None
- In either case, the code returns the data item contained in the deleted node
:::

## Removing at the End 

```{.python}
# Assumes at least one node in structure
removedItem = head.data
if head.next is None:
    head = None
else:
    probe = head
    while probe.next.next != None: # notice this access the last node link from the predecesor.
        probe = probe.next
    removedItem = probe.next.data
    probe.next = None
return removedItem
```
