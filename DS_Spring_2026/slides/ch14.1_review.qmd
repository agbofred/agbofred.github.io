# Data Structures Review: Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Graphs


## Stacks: Fundamentals and Operations
:::{.smaller style="font-size: 26px;"}
| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | A **linear data structure** following **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** principle |
| **Analogy** | Stack of clean trays in a cafeteria; new tray removed from top |
| **Core Operations** | **`push`**: Adds item to top<br>**`pop`**: Removes and returns top item<br>**`peek`**: Returns top item without removing |
| **Python Emulation** | Python list uses `append` for `push` and `pop` for `pop` |
| **Implementation** | **Arrays (`ArrayStack`)** or **Linked structures (`LinkedStack`)**<br>For linked stacks, `pop`/`push` are easy—operations at one end |

::::{.callout-note}
**Reinforcement:** The `pop` operation raises a `KeyError` if the stack is empty.
::::

:::


## Stacks: Applications

### Expression Evaluation
:::{style="font-size: 28px;"}
| Stage | Stack Role | Key Steps |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Infix to Postfix** | Holds operators and left parentheses | **Operands** → appended to PE<br>**Operators** → pushed, respecting precedence<br>**Right parentheses** → pop until left parenthesis |
| **Postfix Evaluation** | Holds operands and intermediate results | Scan left-to-right<br>**Operands** → pushed<br>**Operator** → applied to two popped operands, result pushed |
:::

## Stacks: Applications
### Memory Management (Call Stack)
:::{.incremental style="font-size: 30px;"}
- PVM uses **Call Stack** for subroutine execution
- **Activation record** pushed when subroutine called
- Saves **Return Address** and parameters
- **Popped** when execution finishes
:::

## Stacks: Applications
### Backtracking
:::{.incremental style="font-size: 30px;"}
- Stack **remembers alternative states** at each juncture
- On dead end, backs up to **last unexplored alternative**
- LIFO nature facilitates backtracking
:::



## Queues: Fundamentals and Implementations
:::{.smaller style="font-size: 26px;"}
| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | **Linear collection** with insertions at **rear**, removals at **front**<br>Follows **First-In, First-Out (FIFO)** protocol |
| **Core Operations** | **`add`** (enqueue): Adds item to rear<br>**`pop`** (dequeue): Removes item from front<br>**`peek`**: Returns front item without removing |
| **Applications** | Waiting lines, **Round-Robin CPU Scheduling**, Task scheduling, Disk/Printer access |
| **Linked Implementation** | Uses **`front`** and **`rear`** variables<br>Both set to `None` when queue becomes empty |
| **Array Implementation** | **Circular Array** achieves $O(1)$ for both `add` and `pop`<br>Avoids shifting items |
:::


## Priority Queues and the ER Model

### Priority Queues (PQ)
:::{.incremental style="font-size: 32px;"}
- Assigns **priority** to each item
- **Higher priority** items removed first
- **Equal priority** items removed in **FIFO** order
- **Implementations:** Heap-based (efficient) or Unsorted/Sorted lists
:::

### LinkedPriorityQueue Implementation
:::{.incremental style="font-size: 32px;"}
- Inherits from `LinkedQueue`
- `pop` method inherited (removes head)
- **`add` method overridden** to insert by priority
:::

<!-- ### ER Scheduler Case Study
:::{.incremental style="font-size: 30px;"}
- Uses **Model-View pattern**
- **`ERModel`**: Manages **priority queue** of `Patient` objects
- **`ERView`**: Handles user interaction
- **`Patient`**: Stores name and condition; comparison based on condition priority
- **`Condition`**: Defines ranks (Critical=1, Serious=2, Fair=3)
::: -->

---

## Trees: Fundamentals

### Tree Terminology
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Root** | Topmost node (no parent) |
| **Leaf** | Node with no children |
| **Interior Node** | Node with at least one child |
| **Height** | Length of longest path in tree |
| **Depth/Level** | Length of path connecting node to root |

## Trees: Binary Tree Structure
:::{.incremental style="font-size: 36px;"}
- Empty or consists of root + **left subtree** + **right subtree**
- Each node has **at most two children**
- **Vine-like:** Maximum height $N-1$ (like linked list)
- **Full Binary Tree:** Maximum nodes for height $h$ is $2^{(h+1)} - 1$
- **Complete Binary Tree:** All levels filled (except possibly last, filled left-to-right)
:::

## Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
:::{.incremental style="font-size: 36px;"}
- Each node's **key** > all keys in **left** subtree and < all keys in **right** subtree
- Operations (Search, Insert, Delete) run in **$O(h)$** time
- Interface: `add`, `remove`, `find`, traversal methods
:::

---

## Tree Applications: Traversals

### Binary Tree Traversals
:::{.smaller style="font-size: 34px;"}
| Traversal | Order | Utility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Preorder** | Root, Left, Right | Used by tree's `__iter__` method |
| **Inorder** | Left, Root, Right | Produces **sorted order** on BST |
| **Postorder** | Left, Right, Root | Used in Expression Trees |
| **Level Order** | Level-by-level | Requires **Queue** |
:::


## Expression Trees and Parsing
:::{.incremental style="font-size: 36px;"}
- Represent syntactic structure of expressions
- **Interior nodes:** operators; **Leaf nodes:** operands
- **Scanner:** Performs lexical analysis (produces tokens)
- **Parser:** Syntax analyzer
:::

## Heap Structure and Complexity
:::{.incremental style="font-size: 30px;"}
- Specialized binary trees for Priority Queues
- **Heap Property:** In Min-Heap, parent $\le$ children
- Implemented as **Complete Binary Tree** (facilitates array mapping)
- **Array Indexing:** Parent at **$(i - 1) // 2$**
- **`add`** (heapify up): **$O(\log N)$**
- **`pop`** (heapify down): **$O(\log N)$**
:::

### Graph Fundamentals
:::{.incremental style="font-size: 36px;"}
- Most **general category of collection**
- **Vertices (nodes):** Entities
- **Edges (links):** Relationships

| **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** | Directed graph with **no cycles** | Models **dependencies** (scheduling) |
| **Undirected Graph** | Edges without direction $\{u, v\}$ | Mutual relationships (two-way streets) |
:::
---

## Graph Implementations and Trade-offs

### Linked Structure Implementation
:::{.incremental style="font-size: 30px;"}
- **`LinkedDirectedGraph`**: Main class with **dictionary** mapping labels to `LinkedVertex`
- **`LinkedVertex`**: Represents node; maintains label, `mark`, `edgeList`
- **`LinkedEdge`**: Represents connection; holds `vertex1`, `vertex2`, `weight`
:::

## Graph Representation Analysis

| Representation | Storage | Edge Check $(i \to j)$ | Iterate Neighbors |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adjacency Matrix** | **$O(N^2)$** | **$O(1)$** | $O(N)$ |
| **Adjacency List** | **$O(N + 2M)$** | $O(\deg(i))$ | $O(\deg(v))$ |

:::{.callout-tip}
**Adjacency List** better for **sparse graphs** ($M \ll N^2$)  
**Adjacency Matrix** faster for edge existence checks
:::

---

## Linear Collections: Stacks and Queues

| Feature | Stack (LIFO) | Queue (FIFO) | Priority Queue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Principle** | Last in, first out | Insert rear, remove front | Highest priority out first |
| **Operations** | `push`, `pop`, `peek` | `add`, `pop`, `peek` | `add`, `pop` (by priority) |
| **Linked Impl.** | `push`/`pop` $O(1)$ | `add`/`pop` $O(1)$ | `pop` $O(1)$, `add` $O(N)$ |
| **Array Impl.** | Simple, use `append`/`pop` | $O(1)$ with circular array | Min-Heap for efficiency |

- PVM uses call stack for subroutine calls.
- Activation record holds variables, parameters, return address.

### Linked Structure Implementation
- **LinkedDirectedGraph:** Dict of labels to `LinkedVertex`.
- **LinkedVertex:** Holds label, mark, edge list.
- **LinkedEdge:** Holds from/to vertices, weight.

---

| Feature / Operation | Adjacency Matrix | Adjacency List | Trade-off |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Storage** | $O(N^2)$ | $O(N+2M)$ | Matrix wastes space for sparse graphs |
| **Edge Check** | $O(1)$ | $O(\deg(i))$ | Matrix is faster for edge existence |
