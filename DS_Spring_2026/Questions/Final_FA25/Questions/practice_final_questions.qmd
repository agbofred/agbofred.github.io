### Part 3: Applied Questions (5 Questions)

#### 1. Scenario: Social Media Connectivity

*A software company is modeling user relationships on a new social media platform. They initially used an Adjacency Matrix to represent the "following" relationship. However, they observed that 98% of users follow less than 100 other users, but the platform has millions of users (N is very large).*

**Query:** Explain the performance and storage trade-off implications of using the Adjacency Matrix in this scenario, and recommend the superior alternative representation.

---

#### 2. Scenario: Compiler Optimization

*A compiler is processing a complex arithmetic expression: ((4 + 5) * 6) - 3.*

**Query:** Describe the sequence of steps a stack-based algorithm would perform to evaluate the Postfix equivalent of this expression. Use only the operators and operands from the expression above. Explain what happens to the stack when the first operator * is encountered in the Postfix evaluation process.

---

#### 3. Scenario: Airline Route Mapping

*An airline wants to find the cheapest route between its hub city (S) and all other available cities (V). The cost of flying between any two cities (edges) is always positive. The total number of cities (N) is 100.*

**Query:** Which algorithm—Dijkstra’s or Floyd’s—is appropriate for this task, and what is the computational complexity of the chosen algorithm? Justify your choice based on the problem requirements and time complexity.

---

#### 4. Scenario: Emergency Room Scheduling

*You are designing the ERModel for an Emergency Room Scheduler system, which must manage patients based on priority (Critical=1, Serious=2, Fair=3).*

**Query:** If you use a LinkedPriorityQueue implementation based on a sorted linked list, how does the add method ensure that a new patient item is placed correctly? If the queue currently holds [Patient_A (1), Patient_B (2), Patient_C (2), Patient_D (3)], where would a new patient, Patient_E (2), be inserted, and why?

---

#### 5. Scenario: Tree Structure Verification

*A student has implemented the LinkedBST class and wants to check its integrity by analyzing the visitation order of nodes. The tree contains nodes labeled 10, 5, 15, 3, 7, 12, 18.*

**Query:** Provide the expected node visitation order for the Inorder Traversal and explain why this traversal is particularly useful for verifying a Binary Search Tree (BST).
