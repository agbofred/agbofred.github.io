### Part II: Short Answer Questions (20 Questions)

Please answer the following questions clearly and concisely, drawing only on the provided source materials.


1. List the four general categories of collections defined in the learning objectives.  
    **Answer:** The four general categories are **linear**, **hierarchical**, **graph**, and **unordered**.


2. Compare the relative speeds of **Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort** based on the source material, given that they all have a complexity of $O(n^2)$.  
    **Answer:** Within the $O(n^2)$ complexity class, **Bubble Sort** is described as very slow and should probably never be used. **Selection Sort** is intermediate in speed. **Insertion Sort** is usually the fastest of the three; in fact, for small arrays (e.g., 10 or 15 elements), it is faster than more complicated sorting algorithms.


3. List the three recursive steps required to solve the **Tower of Hanoi** problem involving $n$ disks.  
    **Answer:**  
    1. Move $n-1$ disks from the source rod to the auxiliary rod.  
    2. Move the largest disk (disk $n$) to the destination rod.  
    3. Move $n-1$ disks from the auxiliary rod to the destination rod.

4. Why is the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) introduced in the class, specifically regarding the upcoming Bag Mini-Project?  
    **Answer:** OOP is introduced because it allows students to model real-world entities (like a Bag) as objects. For the Bag mini-project, students will use classes to **represent a Bag** with attributes (like items) and methods (like `add`, `remove`), 

5. Explain the concept of **random access** in arrays and state its running time complexity.  
     **Answer:** Array indexing (random access) means that the computer obtains the location of the $i^{th}$ item by performing a **constant number of steps**. No matter how large the array, it takes the same amount of time to access the first item as the last item. The running time for random access is **O(1)** in both best and worst cases.

6. What are two differences in the memory characteristics between a **traditional array** (or NumPy array) and a standard **Python list**?  
     **Answer:**  
     1. **Memory Layout:** Traditional/NumPy arrays use **contiguous memory**. Python lists are dynamic and store **references to objects** scattered throughout memory.  
     2. **Efficiency/Content:** Traditional/NumPy arrays are **homogeneous** (store elements of a single, fixed type) and are **memory-efficient** for large numeric data. Python lists are **heterogeneous** and less memory-efficient because they store pointers.

7. List two distinct reasons, according to the sources, why standard Python lists are slower than NumPy arrays for large numerical operations.  
     **Answer:**  
     1. Python lists require the system to "de-reference" each pointer one by one.  
     2. The `for` loop used for standard Python list operations is an interpreted operation.  
     3. Python has to perform type checking on each element.  
     4. Each calculation is done separately, unlike the vectorized approach of NumPy. (Any two of these are acceptable).

8. What are the two methods that the `Grid` class (representing a 2D array) must recognize, and what information do they return?  
     **Answer:** The two methods are `getHeight` and `getWidth`. `getHeight` returns the **number of rows**, and `getWidth` returns the **number of columns**.


9. In a **singly linked structure**, why is it easy to get the successor of an item but not easy to get to the predecessor?  
     **Answer:** A singly linked structure accesses the successor of an item by chaining through the single links that emanate from the items. Because each node only contains a reference (link) **to the next node**, there is no direct link to the previous node, making predecessor access difficult.

10. List two crucial consequences regarding memory usage and operation efficiency that arise from the **noncontiguous memory allocation** of linked structures, compared to arrays.  
     **Answer:**  
     1. **Insertion/Removal:** Once an insertion or removal point is found, the operation can take place with **no shifting of data items** in memory.  
     2. **Resizing:** The linked structure can be resized during each insertion or removal with **no extra memory cost and no copying of data items**.

11. Contrast the running time complexity for **Insertion at the end** between a singly linked structure (starting from the head) and a doubly linked structure that maintains a tail pointer.  
     **Answer:**  
     * For a singly linked structure, insertion at the end requires traversing the entire list to find the last node, resulting in $O(n)$ complexity.  
     * For a doubly linked structure that maintains a tail pointer, the tail pointer allows direct, constant-time access to the last node, allowing insertion at the end to be completed in **O(1)** time.


12. Distinguish between an **Abstract Collection Type** and its **Implementations**.  
     **Answer:** **Abstract Collection Types** define the **behavior and operations** of a collection without specifying *how* they are implemented. **Implementations** provide concrete ways to realize these abstract types using specific **data structures and algorithms** (like arrays or linked structures).

13. When implementing the `add` method for a `LinkedBag`, how does the implementation leverage constant-time access, and what does this generally involve changing?  
     **Answer:** The `add` method in `LinkedBag` leverages constant-time $O(1)$ access by placing the new item **at the head** of the linked structure. This involves resetting the instance variable `self.items` to be the new node, which points to the old head.


14.  Define the **space/time trade-off** in algorithm design.  
  **Answer:** When choosing algorithms, one can settle for a space/time trade-off, where an algorithm is designed to achieve **faster run times** (time efficiency) at the cost of using **extra space (memory)**, or vice versa.

15.  If **Insertion Sort** were modified to use binary search to find the insertion point, why would the overall time complexity remain $O(n^2)$?  
  **Answer:** Although using binary search reduces the time for finding the insertion point to $O(\log n)$ per insertion, the total time complexity remains $O(n^2)$ because **shifting elements to make room for the new item still takes $O(n)$ time per insertion**.


16.  Explain what **Vectorization** is in the context of NumPy and why it provides massive speed gains over standard Python lists for numerical operations.  
  **Answer:** Vectorization is the **ability to perform operations on entire arrays at once**, without explicit Python loops. This provides speed gains because the operations are implemented in highly optimized **C/Fortran code** underneath, bypassing the slower interpreted Python loops and type checking.

17.  In a singly linked structure, what are the running time complexities for **Access by position** and **Insertion at the beginning**?  
  **Answer:** Access (by position) takes **$O(n)$** because it requires traversal from the head. Insertion at the beginning takes **$O(1)$** because it only requires updating the head pointer.


18.  When comparing the memory usage of a full **ArrayBag** versus a **LinkedBag** of the same logical size, which implementation uses less memory, and what is the approximate memory cost difference in the worst case?  
  **Answer:** When full, the **ArrayBag uses less memory**. In the worst case, a LinkedBag uses **twice as much memory** as an ArrayBag whose array is full.

19. What is the specific visitation order of the __iter__ method in a stack?
    **Answer:** It visits items from bottom to top.

20. In the algorithm to convert infix to postfix, what is the required action when an operand is encountered?
    **Answer:** Append it to the postfix expression.
